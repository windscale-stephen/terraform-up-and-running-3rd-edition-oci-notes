# terraform-up-and-running-3rd-edition-oci-notes

[This GitHub repo](https://github.com/windscale-stephen/terraform-up-and-running-3rd-edition-oci-notes)
contains my notes on the book [Terraform: Up and Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com),
Third Edition by Yevgeniy Brikman (O'Reilly). Copyright 2022 Yevgeniy Brikman, ISBN 978-098-11674-3.

The code examples for the book are also on GitHub at
[https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code).

Two differences:

* I'm planning to use [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/ "OpenTofu
  homepage") rather than Terraform.
* I'm modifying the examples to work on [Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) using 
  [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) rather than Ubuntu and AWS.

Any suggestions or comments to [Stephen Butler](mailto:stephen@windscale.dev).
