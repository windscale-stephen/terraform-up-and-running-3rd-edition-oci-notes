# terraform-up-and-running-3rd-edition-oci-notes

[This GitHub repo](https://github.com/windscale-stephen/terraform-up-and-running-3rd-edition-oci-notes)
contains my notes on the book [Terraform: Up and Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com),
Third Edition by Yevgeniy Brikman (O'Reilly). Copyright 2022 Yevgeniy Brikman, ISBN 978-098-11674-3.

The code examples for the book are also on GitHub at
[https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code).

Some places you can get the book:

* It's available on O'Reilly Learning at
  [Terraform: Up and Running, 3rd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-up-and/9781098116736/) -
  handy for [Oracle](www.oracle.com/) colleagues! :smiley:
* If you're in South-East England you might find physical copies, and if nothing else can always 
  order at:
  * [Blackwell's, Oxford Broad Street](https://theoxfordmagazine.com/venue/blackwells-bookshop-oxford-broad-street/).
  * [Heffers, Trinity Street, Cambridge](https://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/heffers-bookshop-cambridge).
* There's also the inevitable option of Amazon:
  * [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code/dp/1098116747).
  * [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code/dp/1098116747).

Three differences:

* I'm planning to use [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) rather than Terraform.
* I'm modifying the examples to work on [Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) rather than AWS.
* I'm planning to use [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) rather than Ubuntu.

You'll still need the book to make sense of this. I'm not planning to cover the syntax etc. just how
you implement the examples using OCI as opposed to AWS.

Any suggestions or comments to [Stephen Butler](mailto:stephen@windscale.dev).
